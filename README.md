## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of various regression techniques to predict the width of fish based on their weight, length, and height measurements. The notebook explores data preparation, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NumPy.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is from a fish dataset containing measurements of several fish species, including:

Weight
Lengths (Length1, Length2, Length3)
Height
Width (target variable)
